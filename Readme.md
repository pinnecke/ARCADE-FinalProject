# Project - Selective String pattern matching

 ### Repository for string matching algorithm
  
  Below algorithms are implemented

<ol>
<li>Boyer Moore </li>
<li>Rabin Karp</li>
<li>Knuth Morris Pratt</li>
</ol>

The program can be executed in two modes 

#### 1. Interactive mode

In this mode user is asked to provide input text and pattern

#### 2. Batch mode
<ul>
<li>In this mode user is asked to provide path of the file from which input text is fetched and random pattern is generated or part of the string 
from file is considered to be a pattern </li>

<li>Each algorithm is executed 100 times for every pattern</li>

<li>Average of all 100 execution time gives precise time response of each algorithms in miliSeconds </li>

</ul>
